# Proyecto-2---Bases-de-Datos-I-ITCR




## Description:
LA BELLE ÉPOQUE is a commercial database which allows its users to sell, buy retro and vintage items from the past decades.

## Architecture:
The application is based on the concept of layer system programming, it consists of three layers:

* ### User Interface:
Responsible for displaying the views of the graphical interface through which users interact with the application. This layer does not perform logical processes, it only shows and captures information.

* ### Business Layer:
Responsible for modeling application business rules, performs decision making, calculations, processes and more.

* ### Data Access:
Access layer adatos, abstracts communication from system with the database. This allows data to be obtained and recorded in the database, but this layer does not correspond to the database as such.
